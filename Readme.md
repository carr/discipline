# Discipline

Discipline is a tool to help you stop procrastinating by blocking distracting online content like Facebook, Twitter and other websites.

# Install

To install discipline, run this command:

    gem install discipline

# Usage

To block unwanted online content, run this command in your terminal:

    sudo discipline on
    
To unblock unwanted online content, run the inverse command in your terminal:

    sudo discipline off

The "sudo" mode of operation is required because discipline works by modifying your <tt>/etc/hosts/</tt> file, which requires root access.
    
# Configuration

Create a <tt>~/.discipline_config.yml</tt> file with the following configuration

# Supported platforms

I've tested this only on the OSX operating system, so I have no idea how it behaves on other platforms. It should work on Linux, for Windows I wouldn't get my hopes up.
